•Assignment - Create a small docker image containing a python script you write yourself. It can be any small simple thing that you find personally interesting; a text-mode pick-a-card game or a question-response prompt, or whatever you choose. You don’t need to spend a huge amount of time on the python script, as we are more interested in how you dockerize it, how you organize it, how you comment or document it. 

•Assignment - Create a dockerfile that creates a container that will run a small python script you write yourself. When running, it should listen on port 80 and serve a simple "Hello World: style web page. You can send us the dockerfile and any supporting files in advance, and print out the most important parts and bring them to the interview with you so we can discuss them when you are here. 

•Assignment - Create a basic Jenkins Pipeline that will install a Maven package on a Linux node.
